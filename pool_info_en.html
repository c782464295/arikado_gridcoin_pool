<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is an opensource Gridcoin pool (<a href='https://github.com/sau412/arikado_gridcoin_pool'>github link</a>) created by Vladimir Tsarev, my nickname is sau412 on Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, Github, VK, Gridcoin Slack and Discord. My email is <a href='mailto:sau412@gmail.com'>sau412@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>If you wish to donate, you can send some coins to the pool wallets.</p>
<p>Also English is not my native language, if you find something strange please notify me. If you speak Russian, you can read <a href="https://gridcoinwiki.ru/index.php?title=%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0">Gridcoin wiki in Russian</a></p>
<p>You also can try <a href='./coinhive.php'>reverse pool</a> or <a href='https://hivepool.arikado.ru'>hivepool</a>, where you can mine Monero for Gridcoin.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>In Gridcoin you receive rewards for BOINC projects when your coins stake. Most people recommend having at least 5000 Gridcoin to stake in a timely manner, 6 months is the limit before your rewards expire. So, if you haven't got a lot of Gridcoin and aren't planning on putting money into it you can use one of the pools instead.</p>
<p>Each whitelisted project are rewarded with equal amount of coins. Rewards distributed between Gridcoin users on BOINC projects in accordance with contribution.</p>
<p>When the pool's wallet stakes, the reward is distributed between all projects using pool proportion (see Pool stats page). Each project's reward distributed between contributors in accordance with contribution. Then rewards sent.</p>
